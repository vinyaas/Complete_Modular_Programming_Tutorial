    "### **What is the Factory Design Pattern?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Design Pattern is a **creational design pattern** from the world of object-oriented programming. Its primary purpose is to provide an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allowing subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, it's a way to delegate the instantiation of objects to a separate component (the factory), which decides which subclass to instantiate based on given parameters or configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is it Used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation of Object Creation**: It hides the complexities of creating objects, providing a clean and simple interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loose Coupling**: By relying on abstractions rather than concrete classes, it reduces dependencies within your codebase, making it more modular and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: It makes adding new products (objects) easy without altering existing code, adhering to the **Open/Closed Principle**—classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Centralizing object creation logic simplifies updates, as changes to object creation are confined within the factory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When Should It Be Used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex Object Creation**: When creating an object is not a simple process and involves intricate logic or multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Runtime Object Creation**: When the specific class of the object to be created is determined at runtime based on input, configuration, or environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reducing Code Duplication**: When multiple parts of your code need to create instances of a class, and centralizing this logic prevents duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managing Dependencies**: When you have a system that depends on abstract classes or interfaces, and you want to decouple the implementation from the usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Does It Do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Design Pattern defines a method or class that is responsible for creating objects, instead of having direct calls to the constructors of the concrete classes. This method or class (the factory) decides which subclass should be instantiated and returned, based on parameters or other criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Theoretical Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a scenario where you have a software application that needs to generate different types of documents—**PDF**, **Word**, **Excel** files—based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without the Factory Pattern**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if file_type == 'pdf':\n",
    "    document = PDFDocument()\n",
    "elif file_type == 'word':\n",
    "    document = WordDocument()\n",
    "elif file_type == 'excel':\n",
    "    document = ExcelDocument()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tight Coupling**: Your code depends directly on concrete implementations.\n",
    "- **Maintenance Challenges**: Adding a new document type requires modifying existing conditional logic.\n",
    "- **Code Duplication**: If object creation logic is complex, it might be duplicated in multiple places.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With the Factory Pattern**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You introduce a factory that handles object creation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class DocumentFactory:\n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def create_document(file_type):\n",
    "        if file_type == 'pdf':\n",
    "            return PDFDocument()\n",
    "        elif file_type == 'word':\n",
    "            return WordDocument()\n",
    "        elif file_type == 'excel':\n",
    "            return ExcelDocument()\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise ValueError(\"Unsupported file type\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, your client code simply calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "document = DocumentFactory.create_document(file_type)\n",
    "document.generate(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoupling**: Client code doesn't need to know about the concrete classes.\n",
    "- **Single Responsibility**: The factory handles the creation logic, adhering to the **Single Responsibility Principle**.\n",
    "- **Ease of Extension**: Adding new document types doesn't affect existing client code; you just update the factory.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Creating the Factory**: A class with a method that returns instances of the abstract class, deciding which subclass to instantiate.\n",
