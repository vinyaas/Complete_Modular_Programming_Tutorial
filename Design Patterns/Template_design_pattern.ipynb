    "The Template Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but defers some steps of the algorithm to subclasses. This allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "1. **Abstract Class (Template Class)**: Contains the template method, which defines the algorithm's structure. It also includes methods representing the algorithm's steps. Some of these steps are implemented in the base class, while others are abstract and must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
    "2. **Concrete Class (Subclasses)**: Inherit from the abstract class and implement the abstract methods, defining specific behavior for those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- **Code Reusability**: Common steps of the algorithm are implemented in the abstract class, promoting code reuse.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: Subclasses can change certain steps of the algorithm without altering its structure, enabling flexibility and customization.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation**: It encapsulates the invariant parts of an algorithm in the base class and allows the variation in the subclasses, enhancing maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use\n",
    "- When multiple classes share the same algorithm but differ in specific steps.\n",
    "- When you want to avoid code duplication by extracting common behavior into a shared base class.\n",
    "- When the algorithm's structure needs to remain consistent, but individual steps can vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why to Use\n",
    "- Promotes the reuse of common algorithmic structures.\n",
    "- Facilitates easy maintenance and updates by isolating changes to specific steps.\n",
    "- Enhances code readability and reduces the likelihood of errors by defining a clear template.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applications in End-to-End Data Science Projects\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Abstract Class: Defines the sequence of preprocessing steps (e.g., data cleaning, normalization).\n",
    "   - Concrete Class: Implements specific preprocessing methods for different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - Abstract Class: Outlines steps for generating features (e.g., extraction, transformation).\n",
    "   - Concrete Class: Implements feature generation for specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Training**:\n",
    "   - Abstract Class: Defines the training workflow (e.g., data splitting, model fitting).\n",
    "   - Concrete Class: Implements training logic for different machine learning models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - Abstract Class: Specifies the evaluation process (e.g., metrics calculation, cross-validation).\n",
    "   - Concrete Class: Implements evaluation methods for various performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pipeline Integration**:\n",
    "   - Abstract Class: Defines the overall data science pipeline (e.g., preprocessing, training, evaluation).\n",
    "   - Concrete Class: Implements pipeline steps for specific projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario in Data Science\n",
    "Imagine you are working on a data science project involving customer churn prediction for different telecom companies. The preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical features) and evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall) might be similar, but specific feature engineering techniques and model types could vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Template Design Pattern:\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: Defines a general template for preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.\n",
    "- **Concrete Class**: Implements company-specific feature engineering techniques and model training methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that the overall structure of the data science workflow remains consistent while allowing flexibility in adapting to different company requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Template Design Pattern enhances modularity, maintainability, and reusability in data science projects, making it easier to manage and extend complex workflows. By encapsulating the common structure and allowing customization of specific steps, it provides a robust framework for developing scalable and adaptable data science solutions."

    "### **1. Data Preprocessing Pipelines**\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: Defines common preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, missing value imputation, and data normalization.\n",
    "- **Concrete Class**: Implements specific preprocessing logic tailored to different datasets or business requirements.\n",
    "- **Example**: For a financial dataset, a concrete class might handle specific outlier detection methods, while another class for a retail dataset might focus on encoding categorical variables differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Feature Engineering Frameworks**\n",
    "- **Abstract Class**: Outlines the steps to generate features (e.g., extraction, transformation).\n",
    "- **Concrete Class**: Implements domain-specific feature engineering techniques.\n",
