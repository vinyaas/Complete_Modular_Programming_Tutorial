    "**Data Ingestion and Preprocessing**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, data ingestion and preprocessing are critical steps that involve loading, cleaning, and transforming data into a format suitable for analysis. To achieve this, we can use classes to represent data structures, such as `DataFrame` or `Dataset`. These classes can encapsulate data and provide methods for data manipulation, making it easier to work with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a scenario where we need to load data from a CSV file, handle missing values, and perform data normalization. We can create a `DataFrame` class that has methods for loading data, handling missing values, and performing normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inheritance**: We can use inheritance to create a hierarchy of data structures, such as `BaseDataset` and `DerivedDataset`. The `BaseDataset` class can provide basic methods for data loading and manipulation, while the `DerivedDataset` class can inherit these methods and add additional functionality, such as data normalization.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**: We can use polymorphism to write code that can work with different data structures, such as `load_data` method that can handle different file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON). This allows us to write more flexible code that can adapt to different data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use classes and inheritance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using classes and inheritance in data ingestion and preprocessing provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: By encapsulating data and methods within a class, we can hide internal implementation details and expose only necessary interfaces, making it easier to work with the data.\n",
    "* **Code reuse**: Inheritance allows us to reuse code and reduce duplication, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.\n",

    "**Feature Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering involves transforming and selecting features to improve model performance. To achieve this, we can use classes to represent feature engineering techniques, such as `FeatureScaler` or `FeatureSelector`. These classes can encapsulate logic and provide methods for feature transformation, making it easier to work with features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a scenario where we need to scale features using standardization and select the top 10 features based on correlation with the target variable. We can create a `FeatureScaler` class that has methods for standardization and a `FeatureSelector` class that has methods for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Composition**: We can use composition to combine multiple feature engineering techniques, such as `FeaturePipeline`, to create a workflow of feature transformations. This allows us to chain multiple techniques together and apply them to the data in a single step.\n",

    "Using classes and composition in feature engineering provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Modularity**: By breaking down feature engineering into smaller, independent components, we can easily add or remove techniques from the pipeline, making it easier to experiment and iterate.\n",
    "* **Reusability**: Classes and composition enable us to reuse code and reduce duplication, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.\n",
    "* **Flexibility**: Composition enables us to create complex workflows of feature transformations, making it easier to adapt to changing data sources and formats.\n",

    "**Model Training**\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training involves training a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. To achieve this, we can use classes to represent machine learning models, such as `LinearRegression` or `DecisionTree`. These classes can encapsulate model logic and provide methods for training and prediction, making it easier to work with the model.\n",

The `BaseModel` class can provide basic methods for training and prediction, while the `DerivedModel` class can inherit these methods and add additional functionality, such as regularization.\n",
